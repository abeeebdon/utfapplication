            <p>Welcome to Universal FX Copy Trading.

                <br />
                Universal FX Copy Trading provides a platform for traders of all levels to replicate the trades of successful traders in real-time. By connecting investors with skilled traders, it allows less experienced individuals to potentially profit from the expertise of others in the financial markets. With Universal FX Copy Trading, users can follow and copy the strategies of top traders, diversify their portfolios, and potentially improve their trading outcomes.

                What is COPY TRADING?
                COPY TRADING allows users to grant authority to our COPY TRADER MASTER, who will trade on their behalf. Users may experience both profit and loss, depending on market conditions.

                Users can control their risk by closing the Copy Trading button on time. Universal FX will not be responsible for any losses incurred if users fail to close their Copy Trading button.

                Attention:
